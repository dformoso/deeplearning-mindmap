# Deep Learning Mindmap / Cheatsheet - BETA
A Mindmap summarising Deep Learning concepts, Architectures, and the Tensorflow library.

## Overview
Deep Learning is part of a broader family of Machine Learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, partially supervised, or unsupervised. This is an attempt to summarize this large field in one .PDF file.

## Mindmap on Data Science
Here's another mindmap which focuses on Machine Learning basics and Data Science.

I've built the mindmap with MindNode for the Mac. https://mindnode.com

## 1. Concepts
A partial list of the building blocks of Deep Learning architectures, with notes on the mathematics behind each component.

## 2. Architectures
Different Deep Learning architectures have been developed depending on the question being answered. Here's a list of some of them and notes on tuning.

## 3. Tensorflow
TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. The mindmap lists some of its components, packages, and overall architecture.
